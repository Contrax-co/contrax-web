## Contrax Summary

Contrax is a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) web application that allows users to farm real yield assets with built in auto-compounding. Users can also create tokens and pools in just a few clicks.
Our goal is to lower the barrier of entry to DeFi by ensuring an easy onboarding experience, and only listing farms with rewards from real revenue instead of token inflation.

Contrax is currently Arbitrum exclusive, but will expand to other chains after our beta phase.
