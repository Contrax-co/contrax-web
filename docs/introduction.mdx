## Project Objective

The Contrax project exists to provide DeFi infrastructure for blockchain projects and their communities on Arbitrum, Ethereum mainnet, and beyond. Contrax can work with projects old and new to create and scale a DeFi ecosystem using no-code creation and management tools. Anyone can create tokens and add staking and farming features to them, or add them to existing Arbitrum or mainnet projects, on the Contrax dApp.

## Project Components
