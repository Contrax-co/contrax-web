## How do I purchase TRAX tokens?

The Trax token will be available to purchase during our Token Generation Event for TRAX tokens. Please see the TRAX LGE page in this section for more details.

## Can I earn TRAX Tokens at this time?

Yes, you can! We will be releasing different methods of earning TRAX in the days coming up to the LGE, but the first way you can lock in some rewards is to sign up for early access to the beta [here](https://my.forms.app/form/6127a7e0bd6e4f7f3a71a783), and wait for an invite link to the beta in April. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/CmxCZyq4JM) and check out the "official-giveaways" channel for more information.

## Do I need TRAX or vTRAX tokens to use the Contrax dApp?

No, you do not. All you need is to connectyour metamask wallet like any other web 3 application. However, you will be missing out on DAO participation, DAO rewards, revenue sharing, and other features without the vTRAX token.

## What can TRAX and vTRAX tokens do?

The entire Contrax DAO ecosystem is controlled by vTRAX tokens, which can only be acquired by locking up TRAX tokens. They also can provide rewards and features within the Contrax dApp. For a full list, check out the "Token Uses" page in this section.
