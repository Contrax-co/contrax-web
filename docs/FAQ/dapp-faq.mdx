## What makes it a dApp instead of just an App?

A dApp is a decentralized app, meaning it cannot be controlled by a single entity. Contrax is a dApp because it does not have a back end, nor do we take custody or have any control of your tokens. The core of the application is on the blockchain, and therefore, is not owned by anyone.

## Is Contrax safe to use?

Instead of just saying "yes, trust us," we say: Yes, because you do not have to trust us. Unlike a centralized exchange, the point of a dApp is to be open source with the actual tokens held in smart contracts that only have the keys to withdraw from. Therefore, as long as you know how to deposit and withdraw your funds, you are the one to control them.

## How do deposit and Withdraw my funds?

You need to have Metamask installed on your browser, and you also need to move any tokens to the Arbitrum network. From there, Contrax provides the tools to swap into the farm tokens and start auto-compounding. A more detailed guide on how to do this is coming soon.

## What is Auto-Compounding?

This is one of the most useful farming features which Contrax want to bring to as many tokens and chains as possible. Normally, it takes manual effort with several steps to claim, swap, and and re-stake from farming contracts. With auto-compounding, this manual effort is automated several times a day, allowing for exponential growth for any farm offered on Ethereum and Arbitrum.
