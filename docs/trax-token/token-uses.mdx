## Token Use Cases

The following list covers all of the initial use cases for the TRAX/vTRAX tokens at the time of its dispersal via the LGE. The TRAX token can always be locked for the non-transferable vTRAX token which enables most of the below use cases.

### vTRAX Governance - DAO Governance Voting Rights

The TRAX token is locked to instantly receive the equivalent amount in vTRAX for voting rights. vTRAX gives holders voting power over the Contrax DAO, which makes all decisions related to the Contrax dApp and its features. The token holders submit proposals and vote on decisions on the direction of the Contrax dApp and the allocation of the Contrax DAO Treasury. 

### vTRAX Revenue Share - DAO Revenue Distribution

Holders of vTRAX will also receive weekly shares in revenue from the Contrax DAO. This is the revenue that is generated from auto-compounding as well as any other fees collected by the Contrax dApp. The revenue share will start at a 50-50 split between the DAO Treasury and the vTRAX holders, and is open to revision by the DAO.

### TRAX for Farming - Staking Rewards

Users that provide liquidity into the TRAX-ETH pool and stake their LP tokens in the Contrax dApp earn TRAX bonus at a yearly APY. The APY is up to the DAO to vote on the future yields to reward TRAX-ETH LP Token stakers from the Community allocation.

### TRAX ILP Program - Impermanent Loss Offset 

For select liquidity pools on Contrax: for those who are in a position where their impermanent loss becomes permanent when they withdraw from a pool, if they are in the negative after rewards are taken into consideration, Contrax will reimburse as much as their entire loss. The exact amount will depend on the staking length. The protection will use the[ Bancor ILP contract](https://docs.bancor.network/faqs#2.-impermanent-loss-divergence-loss) which increases 1% protection every day until 100% protection is reached at 100 days.

### TRAX dApp Payments

The Contrax dApp may have features that will allow individuals to make payment in the TRAX token, such as our initial plan of including a “featured tokens” section. In this case, users can directly pay TRAX tokens to the DAO in exchange for these features. Post-LGE, the DAO can add more paid features as it sees fit.
