![Architecture](/images/contrax-dapp/architecture.png)

**Contrax.finance:** The domain for the Contrax web dApp where users generate
requests from.

**Route 53:** The cloud DNS which holds the domain name and directs the request
to Cloudfront.

**Cloudfront:** The AWS component for securely and quickly delivering the
correct services.

**S3 Buckets:** Contains the React code of the web dApp which is retrieved by
Cloudfront.

**API Gateway:** Called by Cloudfront for any backend requests, which knows the
subnet to call within the cloud.

**NAT Gateway:** The only gateway that can call the private subnet which
contains the lambdas to interact with the blockchain

**Backend lambda builder & Contract builder:** Server-less requests for specific
tasks on the blockchain which only get executed when called.

**Code build/deploy**: As commits to the production branch happens, the code is
built and deployed to the necessary buckets.

**Blockchain:** The EVM chains which the lambdas will interact with to deploy
and execute smart contracts.**Dynamo DB:** The private database for the web
dApp. It is only for mapping useful information to enhance the UX experience.

**Cloudwatch:** Monitors the AWS architecture and ensures all components are
working as expected.

**Dashboard:** Provides a way to interact with Cloudwatch and request status
logs.

**GitHub:** The public codebase and entry-point for code into the Contrax
application.

**Developers:** Changes can be suggested by anyone, but are reviewed, approved,
and merged by the active developers of Contrax.
