## Introduction

The Contrax web dApp is the application by which any user can easily create tokens, farms, and pools on the Ethereum and Arbitrum network. It is designed to be general in the types of smart contracts deployable, but focus on popular DeFi contracts, all while accommodating everyone from new users with limited knowledge of DeFi to advanced users that want extra features and a deeper involvement with the DeFi ecosystems.

The ultimate vision for the Contrax dApp is to make the creation of DeFi easy for Arbitrum first, and then for other EVM and eventually non-EVM chains.

## Features

The following features will be available on the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks:

**Token Creation**: The Contrax dApp will allow users to create ERC20 tokens on either the Ethereum or Arbitrum network. The token creation process will be done via an interface that allows the user to set the name, ticker, supply, and decimals. The user can also add features such as auto-burning per trade, auto-fee collection to the creator per trade, and the ability to increase the supply.

**Token Management**: After tokens are created, the Contrax dApp shows the user their created token, and provides them options to transfer it, create pools for swapping with other tokens, and create farms for their tokens.

**Pool Creation/Management**: For either existing assets on Ethereum and Arbitrum, or ones created using Contrax, users can set up pools or contribute to pools that exist on Uniswap and receive LP tokens along with a portion of the fees on all trades for those pools.

**Impermanent Loss Protection on Pools**: To help secure the profitability of Contrax farms, Contrax will offer impermanent loss protection for its most popular pools. This will be in the form of TRAX reimbursement for pools based on how long liquidity was provided.

**Farm Creation/Management**: For either existing pools on Ethereum and Arbitrum, or ones created on Contrax, users can stake the pools' LP tokens for rewards, or set-up LP staking for reward for their own token. Farms can be popular ones already existing on third party sites, or new contracts can be made for farms made through Contrax.

**Auto-compounding Farms**: Unlike most farms where the staking rewards need to be manually withdrawn and re-staked, Contrax can auto-compound rewards so that your rewards work for you as they are earned. This leads to exponential growth in staking rewards for the user. **Token Swaps**: Users can swap between tokens using existing pools or ones created through the Contrax app. All pools will be deployed on Uniswap.
