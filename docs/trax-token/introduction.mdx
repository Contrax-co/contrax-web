## A Disclaimer

This entire section, from the description of the token, it's usage, and its distribution, and the formation of the DAO, are all currently proposed ideas from the Contrax team. Please keep this mind as you read through.

## Introduction

The is governance token of the Contrax DAO is the $TRAX token. The Trax token is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain with a fixed supply of 700 million. A large portion of the supply will be bridged over to the Arbitrum network for the Liquidity Generation Event. The purpose of the token is to be locked for vTRAX, the governance of the Contrax DAO which also provides features and incentives to the Contrax dApp. TRAX and vTRAX create a vote-locking model like that of Curve with the [CRV/veCRV token](https://resources.curve.fi/base-features/understanding-crv). The Contrax dApp will provide a simple mechanism to lock TRAX for vTRAX, which enables voting rights, staking rewards, and a share of treasury revenues. vTRAX is non-transferable, but can always be exchanged back for the liquid and tradeable TRAX token. The full list of token features is explained in the next section: "Token Uses." The TRAX token will enter circulation at the public Liquidity Generation Event event with 3% of the supply given to those who will provide liquidity for the token. See "TRAX Liquidity Generation" for more details.
