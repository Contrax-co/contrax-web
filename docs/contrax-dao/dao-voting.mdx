## DAO Voting Authority

After the public Liquidity Generation Event, the Contrax project will be
controlled by the Contrax DAO. This includes everything from dApp features and
projects to integrate, to the TRAX staking rewards and treasury token
allocations.

Anyone who owns TRAX tokens (whether they are circulating or not) has the
ability to swap for vTRAX, granting the authority to cast votes per their token
allocation size. Each complete vTRAX token constitutes one a vote.

## DAO Voting Structure

It will initially be the responsibility of the Contrax team to facilitate and
execute the DAO voting. The voting mechanism itself is currently in development.
It will initially be the responsibility of the Contrax team to initiate DAO
voting, and to execute the DAO's decisions. As the infrastructure of the DAO
develops, the voting will move to be on-chain, allowing for the actual voting
and its execution to occur without the Contrax team as a point of
centralization.
