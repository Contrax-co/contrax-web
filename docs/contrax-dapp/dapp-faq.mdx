## What makes it a dApp instead of just an App?

Upon its public release, the actual features and functionality of the app will be controlled by the holders of vTRAX tokens. Although the infrastructure currently uses a hybrid approach between centralized and decentralized services, the ultimate goal would be to move both the governance and the architecture to a decentralized model.

## Has the Contrax dApp Launched Yet?

No. The dApp is currently in development. The beta is expected to launch in April. The first public version of the dApp will launch just before the public Liquidity Generation Event.

## What can I do in the Contrax dApp?

The Contrax dApp will allow users to easily create and manage tokens on the Ethereum and Arbitrum networks. It will also allow them to create Uniswap pools for those tokens, and deploy custom farming contracts. Users can use advanced farming features like auto-compounding and impermanent loss protection on both new and existing tokens on Ethereum and Arbitrum.

## What is Auto-Compounding?

This is one of the most useful farming features which Contrax want to bring to as many tokens and chains as possible. Normally, it takes manual effort with several steps to claim, swap, and and re-stake from farming contracts. With auto-compounding, this manual effort is automated several times a day, allowing for exponential growth for any farm offered on Ethereum and Arbitrum.
