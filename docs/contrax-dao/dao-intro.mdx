## A Disclaimer

This entire section, from the description of the token, it's usage, and its
distribution, and the formation of the DAO, are all currently proposed ideas
from the Contrax team. Please keep this mind as you read through.

## The Contrax DAO

The Contrax DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) is the
open-to-participation, decentralized organization that will control the Contrax
Project after its launch. Anyone who holds TRAX tokens will be able to lock them
for vTRAX to vote in the DAO. Voting pertains to the Contrax dApp, the community
TRAX tokens, and the TRAX token treasury.

The DAO is an organization with no central authority and makes all decisions
based on blockchain-based votes by its members. To understand more about DAOs in
general, please read [the explanation of DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/) on
Ethereum.org.

## DAO Description

The DAO itself is currently in the process of creation. Please check back for
more information on the specifics of the Contrax DAO mechanics and voting
methods. You can also see the TRAX section for more information on the
governance token model:

## DAO Launch

The Contrax DAO will launch simultaneously with the TRAX token release in the
public LGE. The LGE is scheduled to be held some time after the release of the
full Contrax dApp.
