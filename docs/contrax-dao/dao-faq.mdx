### Who own the Contrax DAO?

The Contrax DAO does not belong to any organization or individuals. Rather, the
vTRAX token holders control the DAO and make every decision regarding it. The
Contrax team is responsible for setting the initial conditions of the DAO, and
will transition all control of the DAO to the vTRAX token holders after the
release of the token via the public Liquidity Generation Event.

### What does the DAO control?

The DAO controls every aspect related to the Contrax dApp, the DAO treasury, the
revenue, and the community TRAX tokens. Through the DAO voting process, every
decision related to the project is proposed, voted on, and enacted.

### What is the role of the founding team?

At its creation, the DAO will have some partially centralized processes, such as
enforcing voting results or dealing with early bugs or exploits. The purpose of
the team is to transition the Contrax DAO into an entirely decentralized entity
governed exclusively by the Trax token holders.

### How do I vote in the Contrax DAO?

Your voting power in the DAO is determined by the amount of vTRAX tokens you
hold. Voting mechanisms are still in development. We will notify the community
when they are in place.
